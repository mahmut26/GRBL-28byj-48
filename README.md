#GRBL 28byj-48

This is a modified fork from ruizivo/GRBL-28byj-48-Servo.  This modification implements all 3-axises XYZ to a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor.

The motors (28byj-48) are connected to a controller card (Arduino UNO) that uses the chip ULN2003. This board is connected to pins A0, A1, A2, A3 for the Y-Axis(IN4->IN1),  2, 3,4,5 Digital pins to the X-Axis(IN4->IN1), and 8,9,12,13 to the Z-Axis(IN4->IN1).

This work was derived from:

#GRBL 28byj-48 + Servo Motor

This GRBL uses an ugly hack to control two motors unipolar steps as 28byj-48 and also supports a servo motor on pin 11

The motors (28byj-48) are connected to a controller card that uses the chip ULN2003. This board is connected to pins A0, A1, A2, A3 for the Y axis and 2,3,4,5 digital pins to the axis X. The servomotor connected to pin 11 h.

I tested the code very well with 328p (Arduino Uno, Duemilanove etv), not with 2560 (Arduino Mega) because I did not do the alterations in the file cpu_map_atmega2560.h

#grbl_v1_ilk.zip

This library uses a lot of things from above. I changed some pins. The motors (28byj-48) are connected to a controller card (Arduino UNO) that uses the chip ULN2003. Arduino board is connected to pins A0, A1, A2, A3 for the Y-Axis(IN4->IN1),  2, 3,4,5 Digital pins to the X-Axis(IN4->IN1), and 8,9,10,12 to the Z-Axis(IN4->IN1). Spindle or whatever you want to connect can connected by pin 11. 

Spindle stop GRBL code is not changing the value of pin 11. Spindle start GRBL code is needed for pin 11 to start. Spindle control values S0 and S10000 are working for changing the value.  

This is my first Github fork so i hope you will enjoy it.
